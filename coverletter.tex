\opening{Dear Dr. Widrow,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical Option. I would like to apply for the position of Summer Research and Outreach Fellow to work on Analysis and Modelling of Astronomical Measurements from Gaia (Project 7). I have always been keen on learning analysis and modelling of large data sets, and I have a very keen interest in astronomy, making this the ideal research topic for me. In addition, I am very passionate about teaching students of all levels, and being able to share my love for science and engineering. I believe I possess the skills and qualities to be the ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I have a wide array of skills I acquired through coursework as well as my own self-learning. Notably, I have over 3 years of experience programming in Python, utilizing libraries such as SciPy, NumPy and Matplotlib. I am also currently taking a course on Numerical Methods with Python (ENPH 213), where I completed projects on numerical integration, differentiation, matrix solving, and applying these methods to physics problems.

In addition, I have a strong background in teaching students of all levels, from JK to high-school to first-year engineers. I have been a 2nd Degree Black Belt Taekwon-Do Instructor for over 5 years, teaching students aged 7 to 15 martial arts, life skills, and more through evening classes and summer camps. I am also a tutor with EngLinks, an engineering tutoring service where I have conducted a workshop for 20+ students to prepare them for a physics exam.

Furthermore, I am highly skilled at report-writing and project presentation, skills which I have earned through my engineering program. I have been a part of numerous design project teams in which report writing was crucial, and have written over a dozen complex reports such as project proposals, progress reports, final reports, and more. I am also knowledgeable in experimentation methods such as error management, lab book writing, and such. I am confident in my ability to boil down these skills and teach them to a team of students.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
I believe my wide array of skills including Python and Numerical Methods paired with my experience in teaching and teaming make me the ideal candidate for this position. I welcome the opportunity to discuss your requirements in greater detail during a phone or video interview. You can reach me at julian.awad@queensu.ca. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
