\opening{Dear Dr. Fallah,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical Option. I would like to apply for the position of Process Control Engineer to work alongside your research team. Additive manufacturing technologies have interested me for a very long time, and I am confident that this technology will fundamentally alter the way manufacturing is approached in many industries. Given my extensive experience with desktop FDM technologies, working on a project such as yours is an incredible opportunity to participate in advancing these technologies. I am confident that my experience and skills will make me the ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I have over 5 years of experience working with various FDM 3D printers, and have a deep understanding of the entire process, from CAD, to slicer, to each component of the printer. I have developed this knowledge through the creation of my startup company PolyTwist Designs, centered around manufacturing 3D-printed Rubik's Cube puzzles (\url{www.polytwist.xyz}).

I am an effective self-learner with a strong passion for acquiring new skills. I am confident in my ability to self-learn any required knowledge for this position, as proven in many instances such as during my internship at the Department of National Defense, and when starting my small business PolyTwist Designs. I consider myself a strong team player and work very well in collaborative environments. I have been a member of numerous design projects such as APSC100 Mod1, Mod3, and APSC200, where I have often gravitated naturally towards a leadership role through my initiative, follow-through, and superior organisational skills. Using my ability to take initiative, learn quickly, and follow through, I have acquired many technical skills on my own in addition to the ones learned within the context of my degree, such as Python, LabVIEW, various CAD software, and Microsoft Access. I have done this through online resources such as LinkedIn Learning and by taking on various personal projects, such as designing products for my small business and coding a to-do list that automatically sorts and schedules tasks, which posted on my GitHub.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the position of research assistant through my superior learning skills, my strong leadership and teaming ability, and wide array of technical skills relevant to the position. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
