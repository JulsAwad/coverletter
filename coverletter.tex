\opening{Dear Dr. Fallah,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical Option. I would like to apply for the position of Process Control Engineer to work alongside your team. Additive manufacturing technologies have interested me for a very long time, especially its applications in the Aerospace industry. Given my extensive experience with desktop Fusion Depositing Modeling (FDM) technologies, I am confident that my broad experience and wide array of skills will make me the ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I have over 5 years of hands-on experience working with various FDM 3D printers, and have a deep understanding of the entire process, from CAD, to slicer software, to each component of the printer. I have developed this knowledge through the creation of my startup company PolyTwist Designs, centered around designing and manufacturing 3D-printed Rubik's Cube puzzles (\url{www.polytwist.xyz}).

In addition to 3D-printing, I have a wide array of skills relevant to this position, acquired through my academic curriculum as well as independently through personal projects. These include notably Mechanical Design with SolidWorks, LabVIEW, MATLAB, C, and Python. I also have a strong foundation in electrical circuit theory, and an understanding of quantum phenomena and their applications.

Furthermore, I completed an internship with the Department of National Defense where I was responsible for collecting Technical requirements of Armoured Patrol Vehicles from various military bases across Canada. I documented these requirements into concise technical specifications in both English and French. I feel these research skills are applicable to the position and would greatly benefit your project.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
My experiences founding PolyTwist Designs and completing my internship have taught me the value of initiative, resourcefulness, and hard work. Based on my extensive experience in the field and my wide array of relevant technical skills, I believe I can make a significant contribution to your project. I welcome the opportunity to discuss your requirements in greater detail during a phone or video interview. You can reach me at julian.awad@queensu.ca. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you. 

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
