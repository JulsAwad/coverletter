\opening{Dear Mr. Thorogood,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical option, at Queen's University. I would like to apply for the full-time position of 3D print-farm operator with your company for the summer. I find your benchtop CNC router to be an immense innovation for the maker community, of which I have been a part of for over 5 years with my startup PolyTwist Designs. Working for your company would be an incredible opportunity for me to get involved with the emerging market of affordable easy-to-use CNCs, and work with like-minded individuals who share a passion for the maker community.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I believe I am the ideal candidate for this position for many reasons. I have been the primary operator of a small print farm for over 5 years for my startup business PolyTwist Designs, producing 3D-printed puzzles similar to the Rubiks Cube. This makes me extremely knowledgable and experienced in 3D printer troubleshooting, repair, and quality control. In addition, I have many years of experience with mechanical design with SolidWorks and Inventor, development boards such as Arduino, and production work with my aforementioned company. I've self-taught myself most of these skills through running my business, or through various personal projects. I am a driven and passionate team-player, and I will work harder than anyone to get a job done.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe I am an ideal candidate for this position because of my extensive experience, my wide array of skills, and my hard work and passion. With regards to salary expectations, I am willing to negotiate anywhere within the given range. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
