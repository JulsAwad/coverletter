\opening{Dear Dr. Knobel,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical Option. I would like to apply for the position of Nanophotonics Research Center Assistant to work alongside your team. I am a hard-working team player, have an unsatiable passion for learning and tinkering, and I believe these qualities will make me the ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I have co-founded a start-up company called PolyTwist Designs with two colleagues, centered around designing and 3D-printing Rubik's Cube style puzzles with novel shapes, sizes, functions, and challenges (\url{www.polytwist.xyz}). Starting this business has taught me the value of skills like initiative, resourcefulness, and hard work. It has also helped me sharpen my entrepreneurial mind and teaming skills. Over the course of three years of sales, we have made over \$13,000 selling more than 16 different products.

In addition, I've put my strong ability for learning new skills to use over the course of my high-school and university years by learning as many things as possible outside the scope of my courses. These things include Mechanical design with SolidWorks, LabVIEW, MATLAB, and Python to name a few. I have applied these skills in many personal projects, like PolyTwist Designs or the creation of an intelligent to-do list that automatically prioritizes and schedules tasks based on an algorithm and the Google Calendar API (coded in Python).

Furthermore, I completed an internship with the Department of National Defense where I was responsible for collecting Technical requirements of Armoured Patrol Vehicles from various military bases across Canada. I documented these requirements into concise technical specifications in both English and French. This internship helped sharpen my research and documentation skills, which I believe are applicable to this position.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe my experience, skills, and qualities make me a perfect candidate to this position, and I hope to make a significant contribution to your project. I welcome the opportunity to discuss your requirements in greater detail during a phone or video interview. You can reach me at julian.awad@queensu.ca. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
