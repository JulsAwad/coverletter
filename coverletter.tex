\opening{Dear Dr. Sadavoy,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical option. I am applying for the position of Research Assistant in Star Formation. I have always taken a keen interest in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and after researching the topic and taking an introductory course in Special Relativity where I performed exceedingly well, I would now like to get involved within this field of research. Your work in the field is extraordinary, and demonstrates many exciting research topics within this field including your paper on the life cycle of dust and the need for multiwavelength spectroscopy methods. I believe my technical skills, ability to learn quickly, and strong passion would make me an ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I am an effective self-learner with a very strong passion for acquiring new skills. I learn very well independently and through collaborative projects similar to this position, demonstrated when I started my startup company PolyTwist in early high-school. Through this endeavour, I learned many technical skills such as CAD and FDM 3D Printing techniques, as well as soft skills like communications, teamwork, initiative, and follow-through. I consider myself a strong team player and work very well in collaborative environments. I have been a member of numerous design projects such as APSC100 Mod1, Mod3, and APSC200, where I have often gravitated naturally towards a leadership role through my initiative, follow-through, and superior organisational skills. I also have a wide array of technical skills, notably in programming with Python. These skills have been acquired within the context of my degree (ENPH 213, ENPH 252) as well as on my own through personal projects. One such example of these projects is a to-do list that automatically porioritizes and schedules tasks using the GCal API, which can be found on my Github page (see enclosed resume).

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the position of research assistant through my passion for learning, my strong leadership and teaming ability, and wide array of technical skills relevant to the position. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
