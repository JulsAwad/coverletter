\opening{Dear Dr. Sadavoy,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am applying for the position of Research Assistant in Star Formation. I have always taken a keen interest in Astronomy and Astrophysics, and after researching the topic and taking an introductory course in Special Relativity where I performed exceedingly well, I would now like to get involved within this field of research. Your work in the field is extraordinary, and demonstrates many exciting research topics within this field including your paper on the life cycle of dust and the need for multiwavelength spectroscopy methods. I believe my technical skills, ability to learn quickly, and strong passion would make me an ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I am an effective self-learner with a strong passion for acquiring new skills. I am confident in my ability to self-learn any required knowledge for this position, as proven in many instances such as during my internship at the Department of National Defense, and when starting my small business PolyTwist Designs. I consider myself a strong team player and work very well in collaborative environments. I have been a member of numerous design projects such as APSC100 Mod1, Mod3, and APSC200, where I have often gravitated naturally towards a leadership role through my initiative, follow-through, and superior organisational skills. Using my ability to take initiative, learn quickly, and follow through, I have acquired many technical skills on my own in addition to the ones learned within the context of my degree, such as Python, LabVIEW, various CAD software, and Microsoft Access. I have done this through online resources such as LinkedIn Learning and by taking on various personal projects, such as designing products for my small business and coding a to-do list that automatically sorts and schedules tasks, which posted on my GitHub.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the position of research assistant through my superior learning skills, my strong leadership and teaming ability, and wide array of technical skills relevant to the position. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
