\opening{Dear Dr. Fallah,}

%PARAGRAPH 1
%Introduce myself and express my interest in the position
My name is Julian Awad, and I am in my 2nd year of Engineering Physics, Mechanical Option. I would like to apply for the position of Process Control Engineer to work alongside your research team. Additive manufacturing technologies have interested me for a very long time, especially its applications in the Aerospace industry. Given my extensive experience with desktop Fusion Depositing Modeling (FDM) technologies, working on a project such as yours is an incredible opportunity to get hands-on experience in the field. I am passionate about this field of research, and I am confident that my experience and skills will make me the ideal candidate for this position.

%PARAGRAPH 2
%3 qualities, and 3 examples to support, and explain why these qualities are relevant
I have over 5 years of experience working with various FDM 3D printers, and have a deep understanding of the entire process, from CAD, to slicer software, to each component of the printer. I have developed this knowledge through the creation of my startup company PolyTwist Designs, centered around designing and manufacturing 3D-printed Rubik's Cube puzzles (\url{www.polytwist.xyz}). Through this experience, I developed technical skills and soft skills alike, such as leadership, initiative, and hard work.

In addition to 3D-printing, I have a wide array of skills relevant to this position, acquired through my academic curriculum as well as independently through personal projects. Such projects include my startup PolyTwist Designs, and building an intelligent To-Do list with Python and the GCal API, to name a few. The skills I developed include notably Mechanical Design with SolidWorks, LabVIEW, MATLAB, C, and Python, electrical circuit theory, and an understanding of quantum phenomena and their applications.

Furthermore, I have completed an internship with the Department of National Defense where I was responsible for compiling requirements for a purchase description based on multiple military bases' requirements in both English and French. The skills I applied, such as parsing and presenting large ammounts of information in a concise manner, are extremely applicable to a research assistanceship position with you. I am confident these skills would transfer seamlessly and will be of great use to you.

%PARAHRAPH 3
%Restate qualities, thank them for their time etc
Overall, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the position of research assistant due to my extensive experience in the field, and my wide array of technical skills directly relevant to this position. I thank you for your consideration, and eagerly look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
